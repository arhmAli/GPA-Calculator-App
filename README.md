  <h1>Project Description: GPA Calculator Web App</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This project aims to develop a web application for calculating Grade Point Average (GPA) using the React JavaScript library. The GPA Calculator Web App will provide a user-friendly interface that allows students to input their course grades and credit hours to obtain their overall GPA.
  </p>

  <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.</li>
    <li>HTML: Markup language for structuring the web app.</li>
    <li>CSS: Styling language for designing the user interface.</li>
    <li>JavaScript: Programming language used for interactive functionality.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Grade Input: Users can input their course grades, such as A, B, C, etc., for each completed course.</li>
    <li>Credit Hours: Users can enter the credit hours associated with each course.</li>
    <li>GPA Calculation: The web app will automatically calculate the GPA based on the provided grades and credit hours.</li>
    <li>Course List: Users can view and manage a list of their completed courses, including the option to edit or remove entries.</li>
    <li>Responsive Design: The web app will be designed to provide an optimal user experience across different devices and screen sizes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Project Workflow</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Requirements Gathering: Gather the necessary requirements and define the scope of the web app.</li>
    <li>UI/UX Design: Design the user interface and create wireframes/mockups to visualize the app's layout and functionality.</li>
    <li>React Component Development: Implement the necessary React components for inputting grades, credit hours, and displaying the GPA.</li>
    <li>State Management: Utilize React's state management to handle user inputs and perform GPA calculations.</li>
    <li>Styling and Responsiveness: Apply CSS styles to enhance the visual appeal and ensure responsiveness across different devices.</li>
    <li>Testing and Debugging: Perform thorough testing and debugging to identify and fix any issues or bugs.</li>
    <li>Deployment: Deploy the web app to a hosting platform to make it accessible online.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The GPA Calculator Web App provides a convenient tool for students to easily calculate their GPA. The use of React enables a dynamic and interactive user experience, while the absence of a backend or user authentication simplifies the development process. By leveraging modern web technologies, this project aims to create an intuitive and efficient web app that meets the needs of students seeking to manage their academic progress.
